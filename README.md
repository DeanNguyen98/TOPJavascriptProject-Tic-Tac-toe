My simple TIC-TAC-TOE project from The Odin Project Curriculum.

Created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<&nbsp>

What I've learned after this project: 

- Using factory function to create an object.

- Using IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to encapsulate important data and variables.

- Using revealing module pattern to return private variables.

- How to manage indexes in an array.
